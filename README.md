This is a work in progress project. It is aimed at creating some basic wrappers for an email infrastructure that uses the following technologies:

    > OfflineIMAP
    > IMAPFilter
    > Mutt

I have writted a guide to creating such an infrastructure, and these scripts are closely related. Read the guide at dev.velleto.com.
